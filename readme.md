This project was created entirely using THREE.js, utilizing some calculus and creativity to randomly generate particles in a particular shape and color scheme to form the shape of a galaxy.

There is also a GUI that can be used to edit the value on the site locally instead of having to edit the code yourself.
This can be done by simply uncommenting all lines of code that have gui in them in script.js in the src folder.
